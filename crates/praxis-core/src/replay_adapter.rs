//! lifecycle (`judge -> admit -> receipt`), replayed via
//! `bcinr_powl_receipt::replay::PowlReplayVerifier` to produce real
//! [`ConformanceMetrics`].
//!
//! This is a *lifecycle-conformance* model, distinct from the BLAKE3 hash
//! chain in `law.rs`/`receipt_record.rs`: it checks that a receipt only ever
//! gets emitted after judge and admit have fired, in that order (POWL
//! token-passing conformance), not that the hash chain itself is intact
//! (that's `crate::receipt_validator`'s `chain_recompute`/`chain_linkage`
//! stages).
