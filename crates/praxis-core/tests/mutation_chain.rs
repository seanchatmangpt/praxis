//! Mutation testing of the receipt chain validator.
//!
//! Genesis Day 3, phase 2 (mutation testing). Where `fuzz_boundaries.rs` proves
//! the boundaries never *panic*, this file proves the [`ReceiptValidator`]
//! pipeline actually *detects tampering*: we take a known-lawful receipt ledger,
//! apply a catalogue of affidavit-style mutation operators to it, and assert the
//! validator kills every mutant at the stage its design says should catch it.
//!
//! A green pipeline over an unmutated chain is necessary but not sufficient —
//! it only tells us the validator says "yes" to lawful input. Mutation testing
//! is the dual: it tells us the validator says "no" to *every* way we know how to
//! corrupt the ledger, and pins which stage is responsible for each. A mutant
//! that survives (validator still says `ok`) is either a killed test or a real,
//! documented gap in the integrity model.
//!
//! ## Mutation operators
//!
//! | operator        | corruption                                   | designed catch stage        |
//! |-----------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
//! | `EventDrop`     | remove an interior record                    | `chain_linkage`             |
//! | `EventReorder`  | swap two adjacent records                    | `chain_linkage` + `monotonic` |
//! | `FieldFlip`     | flip a hex char of a **preimage** field      | `chain_recompute`           |
//! | `HashTruncate`  | truncate a hex field below 64 chars          | `schema`                    |
//! | `TimestampSkew` | reorder a timestamp (re-sealed, so only the  | `monotonic`                 |
//! |                 | ordering anomaly remains)                    |                             |
//!
//! The pipeline runs **all** stages unconditionally (it does not short-circuit),
//! so a mutant may trip more than one stage; each kill-test asserts the designed
//! stage is *among* the failing stages.
//!
//! ## Known-uncovered classes (documented survivors, not test escapes)
//!
//! Three mutation classes provably cannot be caught by this validator, by
//! design. They are asserted here as *surviving* (verdict stays `ok`) so the
//! coverage boundary is explicit and regression-guarded — if a future change
//! starts catching them, these tests fail loudly and should be promoted to kills.
//!
//!   1. **Out-of-preimage field flips** (`duration_ms`, `activity`). These fields
//!      are deliberately excluded from the BLAKE3 chain preimage (`receipt_record.rs`
//!      documents them as "purely descriptive"), and `token_replay` replays a fixed
//!      lawful lifecycle that ignores them (`replay_adapter.rs`). Nothing hashes or
//!      cross-checks them, so mutating them is undetectable.
//!   2. **Tail drop** — removing the last record yields a strictly-shorter but
//!      internally-consistent prefix. There is no persisted length/terminal
//!      commitment, so a truncated ledger validates clean.
//!   3. **Head drop** — removing the genesis record leaves a chain whose new head
//!      references an absent predecessor, but `chain_linkage` only checks links
//!      for `i >= 1` and there is no genesis anchor (no check that
//!      `records[0].prev_chain_hash == [0u8; 32]`), so it survives.
//!
//! ## Equivalent mutants (documented via cargo-mutants; genuinely unkillable)
//!
//! `cargo mutants -p praxis-core --file receipt_validator.rs --file receipt_record.rs`
//! reports **two equivalent mutants** — mutations with no observable behaviour, so
//! no test can distinguish them from the original. These are design facts, not gaps:
//!
//!   * **`delete field ts_ns from ReceiptRecord::receipt_meta`.** That helper is
//!     called *only* by `recompute_chain_hash`, which passes `self.ts_ns` to
//!     `build_admission_frame` as an explicit argument; the frame reads that
//!     argument, never `meta.ts_ns`. Dropping `meta.ts_ns` therefore cannot change
//!     any hash. (The sibling drops of `meta.activity_idx` / `meta.node_kind` *are*
//!     killed — those fields ARE folded into the frame, and this file's fixture
//!     seals them with non-zero varying values so a drop-to-default changes the hash.)
//!   * **`replace guard metrics.fitness == 0x0001_0000 with true` in
//!     `check_token_replay`.** `replay_adapter::replay_receipt_lifecycle` replays a
//!     fixed lawful `Judged→Admitted→Receipted` sequence for *every* record, so it
//!     always returns fitness `1.0` (`0x0001_0000`); no `ReceiptRecord` input can
//!     make the guard false, so relaxing it to `true` is unobservable. This is the
//!     same design fact as the token_replay known-gap above: the stage is a model
//!     sanity check, not a per-record tamper detector.
//!
//! Two further `check_monotonic` mutants cargo-mutants first reported as survivors
//! (`> → >=` on the future check, `< → <=` on the decrease check) were **killable**
//! boundary escapes and are now killed by the `boundary_*` tests below.
