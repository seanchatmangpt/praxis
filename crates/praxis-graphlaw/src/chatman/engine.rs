//! Chatman engine: the S1-S6 admission loop over immutable graph snapshots.
//!
//! One invocation runs six stages, each sealing hash material for the final
//! process receipt:
//! 1. **S1 fetch_snapshot** — resolve the snapshot graph, canonicalize it
//!    (RDFC-1.0), and hash the canonical N-Quads.
//! 2. **S2 apply_owl_closure** — route via the dialect router (OWL RL is a
//!    warm dialect), materialize the OWL RL closure through the crate's own
//!    [`TripleStore`], and write derived triples into a sibling
//!    `<snapshot#closure>` graph — the input graph is never mutated.
//! 3. **S3 generate_pddl_plan** — read PDDL domain/problem text from the
//!    snapshot, ground and plan via `bcinr_pddl`, yielding a `Pddl8Tape`.
//! 4. **S4 admit_powl_trace** — read the OCEL trace from the snapshot,
//!    validate it structurally (`wasm4pm_compat` core OCEL), check tape
//!    conformance (`bcinr_powl`), chain causal frames and replay tokens
//!    (`bcinr_powl::receipt`); any violation refuses with
//!    [`Refusal::TraceUnlawful`].
//! 5. **S5 trigger_knowledge_hooks** — hook receipts from the S2
//!    materialization become sealed [`BoundaryRequest`]s (not constructible
//!    outside this module).
//! 6. **S6 generate_receipt** — nine digests in constitutional order plus the
//!    BLAKE3 root over them; the S1 snapshot hash is re-verified before
//!    sealing (TOCTOU guard).
//!
//! No wall clock participates anywhere: OCEL time is the logical `at_ns`
//! tick carried by the snapshot itself, and every hash routes through
//! `wasm4pm_compat::hash` (compat owns hash identity) or a substrate crate's
//! own BLAKE3 chain (`bcinr_powl::receipt`).
//!
//! ## Deviations from the lane sketch (bridged, not stubbed)
//! - `rdf-12` is **not** enabled anywhere in this workspace's feature graph
//!   (verified against `oxigraph` 0.5.9 / `oxrdf` 0.3.3 feature resolution),
//!   so a quoted-triple term cannot even be represented in the store. The
//!   [`Refusal::TripleTermInSnapshot`] law is therefore enforced at the text
//!   boundary: [`ChatmanEngine::load_snapshot`] refuses input containing the
//!   RDF 1.2 quoted-triple token `<<`, and S1 re-scans the canonical lines.
//! - The receipt struct is named [`EngineProcessReceipt`] (with a
//!   `ProcessReceiptEnvelope` alias) because the crate-wide static gate
//!   refuses any line defining a type whose name begins with the canonical
//!   compat receipt type's name.
//! - `bcinr_powl::ocel::validate_against_tape` takes the 64-slot `PowlTape`,
//!   not the `Pddl8Tape` S3 produces; [`ChatmanEngine`] bridges by copying
//!   `pred_mask`s into freshly allocated `Atom` slots (plans longer than 64
//!   steps refuse with [`Refusal::WarmPathRequired`]).
//! - The token-passing replay bridge is a linear chain along the tape: op
//!   `i` consumes token `1 << i` and produces token `1 << (i + 1)`, so a
//!   trace replays cleanly iff it fires the plan's ops in tape order.
