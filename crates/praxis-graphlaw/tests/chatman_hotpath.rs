//! Hot-path tests for `AdmissionTable8::lookup`.
//!
//! CRITICAL DOCTRINE (repeated per task instructions): the Chatman constant
//! is 8 LOGICAL TICKS, not wall-clock time. ARM has no cycle counter and the
//! target runtime is WASM with no timing guarantees, so wall-clock timing
//! (`Instant::now`, `TickCounter`) is never the primary correctness gate here.
//!
//! Ground truth read this session (`src/chatman/admission8.rs`, full 482
//! lines):
//! - `AdmissionTable8::lookup` (lines 211-219): `self.entries[state as usize]`
//!   — a single indexed load into a `Box<[Admission8; 256]>`. A `u8` index
//!   into a 256-entry array cannot be out of bounds, so per the doc comment
//!   this "compiles to a single indexed load": no loop, no scan, no
//!   comparison chain.
//! - No logical step counter exists anywhere in `admission8.rs` today (no
//!   field on `AdmissionTable8`, no atomic, no counter parameter threaded
//!   through `lookup`/`admit`/`admit_all`). Adding one that increments
//!   per-atom (not summed across units) and is exposed on `AdmissionTable8`
//!   would touch the struct definition, both constructors' hash material
//!   (`table_hash`, lines 291-308, which must stay a pure function of the
//!   *table*, not of how many times it's been queried), and every call site
//!   — not a "few-line additive change" that can be added without risking the
//!   hash-identity invariant. Per task instructions this crosses the
//!   "genuinely trivial" bar, so `admission8.rs` is left unmodified and the
//!   gap is documented in `gap_step_counter_not_yet_implemented` below.
