//! POWL 2.0 model (Kourani et al. Defs 3.6–3.9): a hierarchy of leaves,
//! partial orders (concurrency), and choice graphs (generalized decision +
//! cyclic logic), plus a *bounded* language interpreter.
//!
//! The full language of a model with a cyclic choice graph is infinite, so
//! [`Powl::language_upto`] enumerates only label-sequences of length `≤ k`.
//! That is exactly what the differential round-trip test compares against the
//! WF-net's bounded token-game language — three independent computations of
//! the same bounded language must agree.
//!
//! ## A separate Lean formalization exists
//!
//! `~/mfact/procint/ProcInt/Models/ChoiceGraph.lean` and
//! `~/mfact/procint/ProcInt/Models/Powl.lean` are a kernel-checked Lean 4
//! formalization (`lake build`, zero unauthorized axioms) of definitions from
//! the same Kourani/Park/van der Aalst paper lineage this module implements.
//! Neither codebase references the other — mfact's own doc comments say those
//! two files port a *different, separate* Rust crate (`wasm4pm-compat`, not
//! `powl2-decompose`). See the doc comments on [`ChoiceGraph`], [`GNode`],
//! and [`Powl`] below for which specific definitions correspond and where
//! the two sides diverge. This is a citation for discoverability only; the
//! two formalizations have not been cross-verified against each other.
